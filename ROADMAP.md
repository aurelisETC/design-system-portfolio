Design System Roadmap
Phase 1 – Discovery & Strategy
Goals: Align on vision, scope, and success metrics.
Key Activities:
Audit existing product UI (screens, components, patterns, accessibility).
Identify key stakeholders and define governance model.
Define design principles and target platforms (web, iOS, Android, etc.).
Deliverables:
UX/UI audit report
Design principles document
Design system vision, scope, and KPIs
Phase 2 – Foundations
Goals: Establish the core visual and interaction language.
Key Activities:
Define color system (semantic + functional tokens).
Define typography scale, spacing, grid, elevation, motion, and iconography rules.
Create base design tokens and map them to platforms (e.g., CSS variables, tokens JSON).
Deliverables:
Foundations library in design tool (e.g., Figma styles)
Token specification (naming convention, JSON or similar)
Accessibility checklist for foundations (contrast, font sizes, motion guidelines)
Phase 3 – Core Components
Goals: Build a robust set of reusable UI components.
Key Activities:
Prioritize components based on product needs (buttons, inputs, forms, navigation, modals, etc.).
Define component anatomy, states, variants, and interaction patterns.
Implement components in code (e.g., React/Vue library) aligned with tokens.
Validate components for accessibility (keyboard, screen readers, ARIA).
Deliverables:
Core component library in design tool
Component code library (versioned, publishable package)
Accessibility test results and fixes
Phase 4 – Documentation & Guidelines
Goals: Make the system understandable and adoptable.
Key Activities:
Document usage guidelines for foundations and components (when/why/how).
Provide code examples, do’s and don’ts, and implementation notes.
Set contribution guidelines and change management process.
Deliverables:
Design system documentation site (e.g., Storybook, custom docs site)
Usage and contribution guidelines
Changelog template and versioning policy
Phase 5 – Integration & Rollout
Goals: Embed the design system into the product development workflow.
Key Activities:
Integrate components into existing product features and new work.
Align design and engineering workflows (files → tickets → code).
Train product teams (workshops, office hours, onboarding materials).
Deliverables:
Integration plan and migration roadmap for legacy UI
Onboarding materials (playbooks, training decks, starter kits)
Adoption metrics dashboard (usage, coverage, feedback)
Phase 6 – Governance & Continuous Improvement
Goals: Ensure long-term quality, consistency, and evolution.
Key Activities:
Establish a design system working group and decision process.
Define intake process for new components/variants and requests.
Set regular review cadence (e.g., quarterly audits, release cycles).
Deliverables:
Governance model and RACI
Backlog of improvements and roadmap for future releases
Regular release notes and updated documentation
